ChIJxWSkx5SJsIkRacQ8SUw4jIg,Casa Pearl,"Our team is very passionate about Casa Pearl's concept, oysters and tacos! At first glance, it may seem like an odd pairing, but doesn't it sound delicious? Oysters play a big part in the aquaculture, livelihood, and history of the Chesapeake Bay. Our team is obsessed with the two, and marrying oysters and tacos in a fun and lively atmosphere is the perfect setting for a memorable meal.

Casa Pearl focuses on quality locally-sourced ingredients, seasoned culinary expertise, and gracious customer service. Our raw bar features many of the delicious fish & shellfish that the Chesapeake Bay region has to offer. Tacos are Latin-inspired, but with a southern twist.

We do not take reservations. First come, first served. Takeout always available.",,689,4.8,"Name: Fat Tuna Grill & Oyster House
