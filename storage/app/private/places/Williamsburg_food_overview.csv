We are not a reservation-based establishment and offer seating on a first-come, first-served basis for all patrons. Our Williamsburg location does not offer reservations unless during lunch and early dinner (before 5:30 PM) for parties of 8 or more.
Our Newport News location features a Private Dining Room, and due to this difference, we offer limited reservations for larger, private parties. Call directly to check availability and learn more about the booking process.",,3796,4.6,"Name: Amber Ox Public House
