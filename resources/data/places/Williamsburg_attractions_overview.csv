Built in 1966 for a student day celebration, it features the iconic love locks and is flanked by benches in a peaceful, wooded setting with clear water, turtles, and good photo opportunities. The nearby reclining-student sculptures and the legend that couples who kiss at the crest will stay together add a romantic, storybook vibe, making it popular for proposals and engagement photos. Some visitors note it feels a bit hidden or more of a nice detour than a destination for a family outing. The area is picturesque in all seasons, though water conditions can vary, so it’s best enjoyed as a brief, serene break from campus life.",,157,4.7,"Name: Governor's Palace

Many describe it as a hidden or secret garden tucked behind the college, with hedges and shade that surround a sunken area where people picnic, relax, or study. It’s a versatile spot for frisbee, light games, and campus events like concerts and graduations, with Adirondack chairs to sit in. Some visitors note it feels more like a broad field than a formal garden, but it remains a beloved green retreat amid the campus. A charming, scenic place to lay in the grass, wander, or enjoy a quiet moment between classes.",,56,4.5,"Name: Williamsburg Botanical Garden and Freedom Park Arboretum

Some visits suffer from slow or understaffed service and occasional order mix-ups, but managers often make things right.
